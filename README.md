# Simple Nodeless Kubernetes Cluster with Milpa and Kiyot

Note: this is based on [upmc-enterprises/kubeadm-aws](https://github.com/upmc-enterprises/kubeadm-aws).

This is a Terraform configuration for provisioning a simple nodeless Kubernetes cluster that uses [Milpa and Kiyot](https://www.elotl.co/kiyotdocs).  Milpa is a nodeless engine developed by Elotl and Kiyot is a CRI that plugs Milpa into Kubernetes.  The script will create a new VPC and subnet then create a nodeless kubernets cluster inside the VPC.

## Setup

Create a file at `~/env.tfvars`:

```
$ cp env.tfvars.example ~/env.tfvars
$ vi ~/env.tfvars
```

Once you have filled in the necessary variables in `env.tfvars`, apply the configuration:

    $ terraform init # Only needed the first time.
    [...]
    $ terraform apply -var-file ~/env.tfvars
    [...]
    Apply complete! Resources: 24 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    master_ip = 3.81.184.107
    worker_ip = 54.90.138.204

This will create a cluster with one master and one worker.

SSH into the master node and check the status of the cluster:

    ubuntu@ip-10-0-100-66:~$ kubectl cluster-info
    Kubernetes master is running at https://10.0.100.66:6443
    KubeDNS is running at https://10.0.100.66:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

    To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
    ubuntu@ip-10-0-100-66:~$ kubectl get nodes
    NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    ip-10-0-100-135   Ready    <none>   62s   v1.14.0
    ip-10-0-100-66    Ready    master   97s   v1.14.0
    ubuntu@ip-10-0-100-66:~$

At this point, the cluster is ready to use.

## Run a Pod

Stateless pods (no persistent volume claims or locally attached volumes) will be scheduled via Milpa. For example:

    ubuntu@ip-10-0-100-66:~$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

will run the pod(s) created by the deployment via Milpa.

If you have both Milpa and non-Milpa workers in your cluster, you can also use a `nodeSelector` to assign a pod to a non-Milpa worker. Label your non-Milpa worker node with e.g. `mycompany.com/worker`, then add a nodeselector:

    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        mycompany.com/worker: ""

## Networking

By default, kubenet is used. You can change this via setting the variable `network-plugin`. Currently `kubenet`, `kube-router`, `flannel` and `calico` are supported.

## Teardown

Make sure all pods and services are removed. On the master:

    ubuntu@ip-10-0-100-66:~$ for ns in $(kubectl get namespaces | tail -n+2 | awk '{print $1}'); do kubectl delete --all deployments --namespace=$ns; kubectl delete --all services --namespace=$ns; kubectl delete --all daemonsets --namespace=$ns; kubectl delete --all pods --namespace=$ns; done
    No resources found
    service "kubernetes" deleted
    No resources found
    No resources found
    [...]
    ubuntu@ip-10-0-100-66:~$

Then you can log out from the master, and use Terraform to tear down the infrastructure:

    $ terraform destroy -var-file ~/env.tfvars
    [...]
    Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 24 to destroy.

    Do you really want to destroy all resources?
      Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
      There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

      Enter a value: yes

    [...]

    Destroy complete! Resources: 24 destroyed.
